# hoods

Give me a lat/lng and I'll give you a neighborhood

See [hoods-as-a-service.herokuapp.com](https://hoods-as-a-service.herokuapp.com) for examples and an HTML5 geolocation demo.

## Notes

- This module doesn't make any network requests.
- All the data is in the module itself. It's under 50MB.
- The neighborhoods boundary data comes from [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm).
- Data was converted from shapefiles to GeoJSON using [gdal](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/).
- The point-in-polygon function is powered by [turf](http://turfjs.org/static/docs/module-turf_inside.html).
- If the given point is in more than one neighborhood, all matches are returned.

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.
